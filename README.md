# SmartAttendance
An android app that scans for near beacons, selects the one with max RSSI (signal strength) and continuously monitor student's status (inside/outside the classroom) based on the signal strength of this beacon. After the session ends, it determines whether the student should get the attendance or not based on the duration he/she stayed inside the classroom. Finally it uploads the result (attended/absent) to Firebase database to simulate the university server.
